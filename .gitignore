# Notes on why one should not include the following
# files/folders in a public repository.

# In general, do not include anything generated by the compiler.
# (As to say, do not include compiled artifacts.)
# Machine code contains sensitive information.
# Assembly code may also contain sensitive information.

# Also, the following statement is obvious, but worth mentioning:
# Assuming one provides all the files necessary to build a project,
# none of these need to be included because the project will be compiled
# for the specific machine running the executable(s).
# Providing these not only pose a security risk, it increases the repo's size.


## Debugging-related folders and/or files
# For mac:
# The .dSYM folder contains information about local file paths
# and the local machine.
# NOTE: Including this in the .gitignore does indicate
# development alongside Xcode.
*.dSYM/

# For Linux:
# The output file should be ignored for the same reasons
# listed above.
# (For this exercise, file name Debug was used.)
./Debug


## Machine Code
# The machine code contains sensitive information about local
# file paths and the machine as well.
*.out
*.exe
*.o

## Preprocessed Source Code
# Same reasoning as above.
*.ii

## Assembly Code
# Depends.
# Do not include if generated by compiler.
# If assembly code was handwritten and only contains logic
# related to the build, use your discretion; include if necessary to build
# the project.
*.s

## LLVM Bitcode
*.bc
